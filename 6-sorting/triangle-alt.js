   * Sort the array of points. By sorting we manage to reduce the number of checks if a 
   * triple is triangle from 3 to a single check. 
   * We don't don't need to check all three A[P] + A[Q] > A[R], A[Q] + A[R] > A[P], A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].
   * We simply can check A[P] + A[Q] > A[R]. Since items are sorted the other two conditions  A[Q] + A[R] > A[P], A[R] + A[P] > A[Q]
   * are already met. Also the fact the we sort doesn't violate the requirement of the task i.e,  A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 â‰¤ P < Q < R < N.
   * That is the initial P, Q, R  indexes might change in the sorted array however that not important based on the triangle checks 
   * i.e. [3, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 3] still meet the triangle requirement although we changed the items when sorting.
